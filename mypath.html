    <H3>My longterm career goal/path</H3>
            <p>Long term goals are not my forte. I have lived for nearly a decade by completely flipping the table every couple of years and taking a new road. But for the clarity of purpose, my goal is to attain as much mobility as possible with my work so that I can spend more time in nature and more easily navigate the world of family raising if and when it comes about. I need to move the strain of labour off of my body and to my brain. I want to work with creative people that see the world through brighter coloured glasses than I so I can learn from them and hopefully give them some structure and leadership in return when trying to complete a project. Team leadership is where I feel the most in the zone while at the same time feeling the pressure of time constraints and customer expectation. 
            </p>
        <H3>My Commitment to Myself and My Team</H3>
            <p>My commitment to myself and all others irrespective of what it is, will always be, to be fair and understanding, respectful and open to others timetables, working styles, views and opinions, limitations and strengths, circumstances and goals. 
                I commit to believing in my ability to assess what is required and how best to achieve what needs to be achieved when it needs to be achieved. If I find myself struggling to see the forest for the trees at any point, my first rule is to actually go to where some trees are and regain perspective of my position in existence. I do something mundane, but of use, and typically physical so the mind has no choice but to focus on the task at hand and disconnect from the area of stress. 
            </p>
        <H3>Where I will seek Help</H3>    
            <p>Probably the most important one for me… My process should be as follows. Talk with someone who I trust and knows something of the subject/situation I am stuck on. That person is impossible to specify as it changes widely depending on the situation. But almost always it will involve a written message of some kind or a phone call if possible. Secondly if no answers come from option 1, I turn to the team I am with and ask their thoughts via whatever channel is open to me to contact them. When in the confines of the course then my next option is you, the facilitator.
            </p>
        <H3>My expectation of the facilitation team</H3>    
        <p>Though the design of this academy is a conscious attempt at not following the old model of dictate then test, I do still hold the facilitators to some of the old standards. Like having the answers to any question that is specifically inside the curriculum that they are facilitating and also be able to communicate the pathway to that answer to any student that asks it of them in a timely manner. I expect a reasonable standard of accessibility to communicate with them on any given working weekday in regard to these topics. And outside of workdays if the situation of the student is important and requires it. It’s important to note that the first impressions of the course don’t give me any cause for concern in these matters.
        </p>
        <H3>Scheduling time</H3>
        <p>As of this time of writing, I currently am in a position of privileged when it comes to time. I have no dependants and no explicit pressures on my time. I tried to make sure that my time, during this course was as uninterrupted as it could be, to give myself the best chance of success knowing how much ground I need to cover.  I have a family situation with my grandfather but there is no telling at this precise moment how that will play out but by the time this goes to review with my facilitator more will be known. Luckily my stamina and freedom combined allow me a great deal of room to best organise my time during this course and as this is a central concept of my long term goals with my career  I intend to play with it a lot so I can find what workdays suit me best. Right now its from when I am human (post coffee roughly 8:30am) to when I lose that status somewhere close to midnight minus breaks to do something physical to keep my body in check.
