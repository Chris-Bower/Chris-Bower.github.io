    <header class="header"> THE HOT TOPIC OF EQ</header>
        <H3>Context</H3>
            <p>For some context I think I will start from my beginning position on this new metric. And I am focusing in on the metric. Not the skill or set of skills that you learn to help you cope with your own existence and that of others in the world. Because that topic resides in the vast majority of texts that have ever been written by human hands. After watching many debates, discussions, you tube videos of people talking about their point of view of this, I sat in the sceptical camp. I thought it was the same thing as the new pop star of the day having a hit song, which is actually an old song just sung by someone new with a new style that resonated with the newer younger audience. Because it was a peer (generationally speaking) and not someone from the past singing it. And it had a couple of sound effects that were not really available at the original time of composition. Do I sit there now? I can say I have shifted, if only slightly. Mostly due to my understanding of my own ignorance in general.

        <H3>WHAT IS IT??</H3>
            <p>Emotional Quotient <br> 
                The averaged measure of your ability to understand what is happening internally to your own mind and body, and be able to see that in others, and to use that to behave socially in a manner that is potentially beneficial for both you and the others in the interactions. The ability to consciously react to, regulate and manipulate your own emotions and state of mind, to achieve a more desired quality of life.

        <H3>HOW IS IT NOT LIKE IQ?</H3>    
            <p>Because IQ is by enlarge understood to be innate, in your brain by the magic of genetics, it doesn’t really allow for too much debate or improvement. Whereas the metric of EQ has much more space to play around in as there are large parts of its measures that can be trained into an individual and therefore have much more potential for improvement. It focuses more on your unique human side than your problem-solving skills. It is safe to say I believe, that if you have a high IQ, then the odds of your EQ being high is much greater than if you had a low IQ. But like everything there are exceptions and exploiting these exceptions might be the difference between society as a whole, getting better, or not.
            </p>
        <H3>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?</H3>
        <p>Is an external measure of your ability at being human important? Are IQ measures important? Are personality measurements in general important? I think that if you believe the answer to one of those questions is ‘yes’… then you must say the same for them all.  If they are important, it will be because, KNOWLEDGE IS POWER! So, if we know and understand more about ourselves, the more chance we can empathise with others, and the more powerful we can become at having an effect on the world. (Hopefully positive!)</p>
