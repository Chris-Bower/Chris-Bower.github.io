          <h3>Have I learnt new things about myself during EDA core learning?</h3>
             <p>
              I cannot say that I have found brand new sides of myself during this side of the foundations course. Other than my complete lack of ability to do something quickly rather than perfectly. Mostly I have reaffirmed my suspicions that I have a lot to learn about others views on things like EQ and how best to act in life, because when discussing the topics over the past few weeks it has been clear I am not where others are. If my ego is playing a role here its due to believing I have spent more time deliberating on the topics, than others might have. Which of course is almost impossible to know. I do find, when spending time on these things, my contrarian-sceptical side fires up quickly. Its not without any footing that it does this but like all parts of our personalities, it can go from being useful to being unhelpful quicker than we can recognise at times
             </p>
          <h3>The role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming</h3>
             <P>
               No matter what you are doing in life, it is, in theory, being done with the belief that it is better than the alternatives. Whether it be for yourself, or for others. Either way, the only way to decide if it is better than the alternatives is to have some idea of what the consequences of the alternatives are. And right there you just constructed a set of values. You value what you chose to do more than what you could have chosen to do. To be helpful to yourself and the world around you, requires you to have and understanding of that value structure. To be able to see and understand what you value and what others value, helps you to understand what you can do to be able to spend more time doing what you and others value. And like you have likely heard many times before. “if you don’t know yourself then you will never truly know anyone else” and programming is just the making of more environments where people can more easily engage with what they value. So, the more you can empathise with someone else’s situation, the more likely you are to be able to make something that can be of help to them.

          <h3>What are the most challenging aspects of learning core skills?</h3>
             <P>
              Simply being more aware of something doesn't mean it will be comforting. For me, its always learning how much distance there is between me, and those that are, by convention, expected to be near me. A simpler way to say it would be, where I thought safety was, isn't where it was at all. And that's not a fun place to be psychologically. However, its always in the un-fun places where you have the best chance of getting to a better place.

          <h3>Why is a web development school putting so much time and effort on personal development skills?</h3> 
             <p>
                Because it didn't think that cramming coding skills into people heads over 3 months was enough of a challenge?...Because the name 'web development and personal development school' doesn't role of the tongue so easily?  Or is it because it's what google did so what google does we all must do? One would hope not. It is because the role of a programmer is really about working both with, and for others, that all have their own unique characteristics and what you can achieve alone is a fraction of what you could achieve with them all.  To understand that and help students keep a part of their focus on that will likely help the industry from turning toxic to its own members.
             </p>
           <h3>Do I think that the core skills part of this course is a waste of time and should be spent learning more programming skills?</h3>
             <P>
                I only have to think for a few seconds to realise that I have absolutely no idea what the current working environment is like inside a web development business. I do not know what issues crop up within teams more often than others. I don't know where the disconnects are between professional and customer. And for this reason, I chose to do this course because from what intel I got, it had a reputation of training programmers that the industry wanted to hire. In saying that do I wish I had learnt more code than I have? Yes. I feel barely more knowledgeable than I did 5 weeks ago. But again, I have no idea where I am in relation to where I should be. So I am at the mercy of the school to be truly effective at training me in the best way it knows how. It's the conscience of those running the school that is in question in regard to the curriculum choice. Not the humble naïve student.
