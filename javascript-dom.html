        <h3>HTML VS CSS</h3>
        <p>For the tradies out there, curious about what those nerds do looking at screens all day. If they are web programmers then they are most likely using computer languages to create models that end up becoming what you see when you type in your search for some website you want to look at.
            To create those models they must use languages that the computer understands as commands to successfully show you the fun and interactive sites you go to. 2 of those languages are HTML and CSS. HTML is like your young apprentice builder or just qualified builder. It knows how to generally build frames and join them together to form your house. And put up the gib and outside cladding to make it a functional house that keeps the water out, but essentially looks like a box with a roof on it. Does the necessary part of keeping you warm and dry but doesn’t ‘feel like a home.’ This is where that nerd programmer uses CSS. CSS is like the team of plasterers, painters, plumbers, landscape gardeners and electricians that finish off the house to make it look and feel like a home by styling and adding all the little lights and fixtures that look great and define each space to be unmistakeably that area. This language is the one that adds all the colours, textures and forms of the webpages that make it easier for your eyes to navigate around them.
        </p>
        <h3>CONTROL FLOW AND LOOPS</h3>
        <p>Control flow and Loops are just processes, or lets say ‘rules’ that allow the many moving parts of a website to behave in an orderly fashion ( in other words, how we want it to behave). You know exactly what I mean because this is how your everyday life works. In our society, you are bound to behave according to laws. IF it is true that you are 18 years old OR over, you can buy alcohol from a store that sells it. If you are not, then you cannot. Simple isn’t it. It’s the same with telling a computer, you must give it rules on what is true and what is not. If something is true, then it can do something ( that we tell it to do) if not, then DO NOT do the thing. Like in society we use laws to control the flow of people’s behaviour in it. We use IF and ELSE rules to control the possible actions that the computer takes on behalf of our commands. Loops do this like a bouncer does at the door of a nightclub. The bodyguard repeatedly checks the details of each and every person wanting to enter the nightclub. They check if the persons details match the rules of the club, like age, dress and level of sobriety. If the person matches the rules then access is granted. If not, then not. Programmers use this same method of checking large amounts of information in objects. By checking every possible element on the object to see if it contains the things its looking for then it groups together the elements that match the search and discards the elements that don’t match.</p>
        <h3>WHAT IS THE 'DOM'??</h3>
        <p>Yet another acronym in our world of language D.O.M short for Document Object Model. What is a model? A scaled down simplified version of the real thing? A person walking along stage with some clothes on? In the world of websites its more like a plan. A plan of a maze lets say.  That simple diagram that lays out all the pathways and walls and landmarks inside of the actual maze. This map helps you figure out how to best design the maze so that its fun and difficult but also finish able. Because who wants a maze that you cant get through? And because the plan is just a drawing. You can change the drawing by adding lines or walls to make the maze more like how you want it to be. The DOM is this plan, for websites with one advantage. When you draw the extra walls or lines on it, it appears in the website immediately. The DOM gives a programmer the exact plan of a website in its current form, with all its details so the programmer can add or remove things to make it more how they want it to be. They can change the words that appear or the colours that the webpage has or even make it behave differently when you click on some part of it.</p>
        <h3>ARRAYS AND OBJECTS</h3>
        <p>To make sense of these two things we must define them. An array is just a list. Like your shopping list. If you number each item on your list then you can easily say either the items name or it’s number and it will mean the same thing  An Object however is more like specific info about one of your shopping list items like its brand and size or its price, so you can see the overall cost of your full shopping list. Finding something in an array can be as simple as saying its number or name . But finding something in an object requires you to know what items might have what you are looking for. So you need to check through that list of those items and then check them for the detail you are trying to find. </p>
        <h3>FUNCTIONS AND THEIR PURPOSE</h3>
        <p>Functions functions functions. Imagine you had to describe to your child how to put their pants on for the first time. How would you describe each step to take to successfully have those pants where they should be? That series of repeatable steps is what you would call instructions. Instructions that will work every time your child puts their pants on no matter where they are or what type of pants they are to put on. Well a function is exactly this set of instructions. Every time we want a computer to do something and be able to repeat that every time we want it to. We must write the function that it will understand to do that. Every time you click on the play button, the computer is to play the video. So the steps its must take to do that we put into a function  </p>
