        <h3>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I GET BLOCKED</h3>
          <P>
                The heading almost makes it sound like its just an occurance and not the bulk of my time, learning to code. But let it be known that is the latter that is true. <br>
                What to do when you are spitting abusive epithets at the screen and wondering why your brain has failed to even respond to you when called. Its not easy regaining composure when at this stage but as it has been said all before. "BREATHE" <br>
                A problem I had this week was a challenge called 'gradebook'. Essentially this is taking two lists, of different items, and the goal was to turn these 2 lists into 1 list and work out some simple math equations with his new list. To go and walk outside or look at anything other than the screen is always my first response when stuck on one part of the code I am trying to write. Then I try to research another angle of the problem I am trying to solvbe to see if any clues appear. Then try something even if it feels completely wrong or nieve. And when it gets stupid, write out in plain english what the hell I am trying to achieve, step by step by step. <br>
                Most of my time in the past couple of weeks in this course has been almost complety on edge. It is never comforting to see your ignorance and failing play out before your own eyes hour after hour. But you always learn more about yourself in those moments and my ability to forget and keep moving is going to be of value no matter what I do in life.

        <h3>SOLVING A PROBLEM ELEGANTLY</h3>
          <P>
                When I achieve this for the first time, I will let you know.. just getting something right after many failed attempts can feel elegant if only for a brief moment. If it happens it will almost certainly happen in this order. <br>
                After just finishing a 10 minute meditation technique, when your mind is calm and focused, you sit in front of your workspace, write down what you want to achieve with that task in order of actions necessary to take. Research each action quickly and find the correct way to achieve each action. implement the actions and watch as the problem dissolves in front of you. Make sure to reflect on what you did by writing down what yo did and how you did it and then re read that as your ego could do with a bit of encouragement ;)
