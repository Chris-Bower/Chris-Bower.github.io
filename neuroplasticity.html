    <h3>CAN YOUR BRAIN CHANGE</h3> 

     <p>
         Neuroplasticity is a fun word to say and sounds scientific. When distilled down to its most basic form it means, shockingly, that you CAN learn! And you can be more capable tomorrow, than you are today. Scientifically, it is the suggestion that the brain actually has the ability and capacity to expand, create new pathways or increase the capacity of existing pathways giving you as an individual, more room to store more knowledge and use that extra knowledge to be more formidable in the world for as long as you are in it. Though the message that “with practice comes skill” hasn’t been completely lost. It has probably lost its impact as most sayings do as they get lumped into the uninteresting category of “Clichés”. But it is TRUE! With repetition of deliberate practice and a motivation to get better, you can and WILL get better. The $1’000’000 question though is as it always is “how much better??”  and if the top line of this paragraph had you shocked, then this will be as equally shocking, WE DON’T KNOW. It differs from person to person and from skill to skill. And one of your life missions should be to find which skills you are best at learning. But since there are only 2 ways really, to take this enlightening information, it would be best to take it the more positive way, that you have potential. That you can become more skilled than you are right now at something. That you can both make your life better and others lives better too. If you assign yourself a goal, that isn’t ridiculous, that has meaning for you, and you think will be good for you and others too, ( because sometimes doing something just for yourself isn't enough of a motivator) then GET TO IT! Find out where you are, where you need to be, and how to get there. Then practice practice practice! my friend. Give yourself the room to fail, because you will… a lot. But if you hold onto that goal and you can get cunning about how to hold on to it when it tries to get away from you, then you will develop, you will be able to have more impact on the world. If the thought of your brain evolving inside your head along with your evolution as you learn and grow helps you believe that all this is possible? Then take that to the bank and run all the way!

       <h3>THE GROWTH MINDSET</h3>
       <p>
        The elusive power of confidence. Belief in yourself, faith in yourself, trust yourself, or a dogged stubbornness to make SOME progress no matter how little or how hard.. This is the growth mindset.  “I'm not good enough” “There's no point, I'll never get there” “this is where I belong, I will never be capable of doing anything else”.. this is the sound you'll hear in your head when it has a “fixed mindset”. Our minds have been in both these places many times in our lives, and it should not be too hard to recognise which one is more likely to have a positive effect on your life. In a world that is developing and moving faster as we collectively get better at sharing knowledge and creating new and more efficient ideas, it is very easy to fall into that fixed mindset. One aim of each of your days on this earth should be to recognise when you’re in that frame of mind and find your way out of it and back to a “growth mindset”.  Because that’s going to give you a much better chance of improving your situation than the other. In fact your mindset does change your body and how it responds to things, so that should be reason enough to work at spending less time living in doubt and more time thinking of opportunity.  One of the best talks I have seen on this very issue is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-079YIasck">Shi Heng YI | TEDxVitosha</a> <br> 
        Please watch if you haven't before and if you have, watch it again. Its always worth re-entering it into your psyche. Your mind will lead you astray if you let it. But what goes astray can also come back home. Life isn't an easy yes/no survey. Its Hard and full of confusion but you have the tools in that brain, to make it a little bit better and a little bit less confusing. I try everyday to see where I'm lacking and try to lack a little bit less. To be able to help a little bit more. I try hard to accept when I have gone off track and slowly work my way back on track. I hope you find your way and that it gives you more than you could have imagined.
