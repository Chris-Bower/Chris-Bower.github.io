        <h3>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I GET BLOCKED</h3>
          <P>
                The heading almost makes it sound like its just an occurance and not the bulk of my time, learning to code. But let it be known that is the latter that is true. <br>
                What to do when you are spitting abusive epithets at the screen and wondering why your brain has failed to even respond to you when called. Its not easy regaining composure when at this stage but as it has been said all before. "BREATHE" <br>
                A problem I had this week was a challenge called 'gradebook'. Essentially this is taking two lists, of different items, and the goal was to turn these 2 lists into 1 list and work out some simple math equations with his new list. To go and walk outside or look at anything other than the screen is always my first response when stuck on one part of the code I am trying to write. Then I try to research another angle of the problem I am trying to solvbe to see if any clues appear. Then try something even if it feels completely wrong or nieve. And when it gets stupid, write out in plain english what the hell I am trying to achieve, step by step by step. <br>
                Most of my time in the past couple of weeks in this course has been almost complety on edge. It is never comforting to see your ignorance and failing play out before your own eyes hour after hour. But you always learn more about yourself in those moments and my ability to forget and keep moving is going to be of value no matter what I do in life.

        <h3>SOLVING A PROBLEM ELEGANTLY</h3>
          <P>
                When I achieve this for the first time, I will let you know.. just getting something right after many failed attempts can feel elegant if only for a brief moment. If it happens it will almost certainly happen in this order. <br>
                After just finishing a 10 minute meditation technique, when your mind is calm and focused, you sit in front of your workspace, write down what you want to achieve with that task in order of actions necessary to take. Research each action quickly and find the correct way to achieve each action. implement the actions and watch as the problem dissolves in front of you. Make sure to reflect on what you did by writing down what yo did and how you did it and then re read that as your ego could do with a bit of encouragement ;)

        <h3>THE PROBLEM SOLVING METHODS IN MY ARSENAL</h3>  
          <p>
               There are a multitude of tools that can be used to get around that painful blocked state in programming. the basics like asking for help, always prove to be not so basic for me as I have mentioned many times. It has been key to getting across the line everytime something has stumped me though so it should be used more and more. Pseudocode ( writing out in plain english what actions need to be taken) is something that should be first on the to do list everytime but I have trouble with doing when I feel the time pressure. <br>
               Console.logging and reading error messages is great and I have a fairly confident grasp on using that to my advantage. Googling is a pet peeve. I hate it becasue I struggle to use the best keywords and then filter to what I am looking for. It alwasy feels like im looking for too long. But again. fundamental to getting across the line. <br>
               The rubber ducky method... talking to an inanimate object as if its sentient and trying to gather answers from it is one poor substitute for the prayer method that religious people have. I find it better to type out a question to others with hte intention of sending it becasue then I know have to describe it as clear as I can for someone else to understand and then, sometimes, the lightbulb lights up in my head. And I dont have to send the message off. <br>
               I need to focus more on the reflection part of my study. i know its power but it always gets bumped down the priority list for other tasks that feel more importanbt to complete in any given day. <br>
               but we must try all of these to make progress and be better each day.
